          Knowledge and experience in various development methods and work
          processes, and above all agile system development methods.
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the fourth course period I had an internship at Judilica, a
          start-up that develops digital tools for legal work (mainly). The
          internship was fully remote and lasted for six months, during which I
          and a fellow intern had the task of creating the company's landing
          page from design to deployment (CI/CD). The frontend technologies that
          I got to learn more about and work with during the internship are
          Next.js, React, TypeScript and Sass.
        </p>

        <p>
          Judilica as a company is one that aim to work in an agile fashion.
          This I noticed from the very start at our introduction meeting with
          the team. The online meeting started off with a small team development
          session, during which I was able to get to know and connect with the
          entire team. In regards to the five stages of group development
          (posited by Bruce Tuckman), this session took the new team
          constellation from forming to norming. This was really good because
          even through I was mainly in contact with our mentor, I still felt
          comfortable reaching out the other members of the team when it was
          necessary throughout the internship.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the structure for the overall planning was already in place, it
          easy for me to dive into the project and for us to begin with planning
          phase. The entire team collaborated in Notion and we were assigned our
          own workspace for the landing page which we were responsible of
          populating and maintaining. Below is a picture from the kanban board
          that I and the fellow intern created and maintained throughout the
          internship. The purpose of the kanban board was to help visualize work
          and maximize efficiency (flow). During the design phase we created the
          different tasks directly in notion, during the implementation phase
          the tasks were generated from our Github issues.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          The Scrum methodology was applied throughout the project, we worked in
          iterations (weekly sprints). We started of each week by reviewing our
          backlog and discussing and deciding on the features that were to be
          implemented for the week (sprint planning and sprint backlog).
          Throughout the week and as we worked on the project we had daily
          stand-ups. At the end of each week we would have an increment during
          which we presented the work that had been carried out to our mentor
          and received feedback, which we would review at the start on the
          following week (sprint review and retrospective).

        <p>
          An agile concept that I had the opportunity to learn more and work
          with during the internship continuous integration (CI) and continuous
          deployment (CD), using Github and Vercel. Below is an image from our
          slack channel of automated messages from Vercel with two deployments
          that were made by me.

        <h3>Methods of quality assurance.</h3>
        <h4>
          Below is the process (and methods) of quality assurance that I applied
          during my internship:
        </h4>

        <p>
          I started off with creating a new branch (normally from the main
          branch) for the feature that I was going to develop. This was required
          for all new features and changes and enabled for a more manage way to
          conduct unit testing during the implementation and before the
          integration (test driven development). Once I was done developing the
          first iteration of the feature, I would push it to our remote
          repository and create a pull request. My mentor would then review the
          code (static testing) and then share feedback on what needed/could be
          improved. The process would then repeat until the pull request was
          approved and ready to merge with the main branch. Before a pull
          request could be merged with main, it had pass a few pull request
          checks - the most important being a successful deployment of the
          branch by its own. Once all the checks were passed and conflicts
          resolved between the feature's branch and the main branch, the branch
          was ready to me merged with main.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also learned that whilst working with CI/CD, it was wise to run a
          build test locally to amend any build issues and errors before pushing
          the code. As well as configure auto formatting to avoid running into
          unnecessary conflicts, in particularly when working a project with
          multiple developer.

        <h4>
          Other methods of quality assurance that I worked with during CP4 were
          :
        </h4>
        <p>
          &#x2747; Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), in particularly when
          designing the landing page. Things such as checking the color contrast
          of the buttons with a color checking tool and increasing the font
          weight on smaller text to increase the accessibility visually. When
          working with the different animations on the page, I also took in
          consideration not to go overboard with the different effects for the
          same purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          &#x2747; TypeScript (instead of JavaScript) which I consider to be a
          method of quality assurance when developing as it helps catch mistakes
          early through a type system and makes debugging easier.

          Choose work and project methodology and make independent decisions
          about planning and work according to requirement specifications
          against set quality requirements in delivery.
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the things that I found rewarding when it came to my internship
          was the opportunity to create the landing page from scratch and have
          responsibility for the entire development. This meant that I got the
          chance to choose work and project methodology, as well as make
          independent decisions about planning and work according to requirement
          specifications set by our mentor (our stakeholder). Below are a few
          occasions in regards this course goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting off I collaborated with my fellow intern to create backlog
          activities for the design process. The main activities that we planned
          and carried out were wire-framing, loFi and hiFi prototyping. The
          wire-framing we collaborated on and created together as we need to be
          on the same page when it came to which features were to be included on
          the landing page. The features that we decided on were based on the
          requirements in the project specification for the landing page, which
          we had received at the beginning of the project.
        </p>

        <button class="collapsible">Click to expand</button>
        <div class="content">
          <div>
            <p>Wire-frame</p>
            <img src="" alt="a screenshot of a wire-frame created in Figma" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          After receiving approval from our stakeholder that the wire-frame met
          requirement (mainly that the required features and elements were
          included in the design), we decided to work individually on the loFi
          prototypes. This in order to provide our stakeholders with different
          design options and for us to gain a sense of what appealed to them
          visually. This helped us when it came to hiFi prototyping as the loFi
          design that they had settled for gave a good idea of what design style
          appealed to the stakeholders.
        </p>

            />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Aside from the required features and elements in the project specification, the process requirements of the project was also specified in the project specification. Mainly deciding and diving everyday operations/work methods with an agile approach, as well as using a kanban board (in notion). When developing I utilized Github issues to create requirement specifications for both new features that I implemented as well as bug fixes. The issues were connected to our kanban board in notion. </p>

        <p> Below is a screenshot of an issue that I created for correcting the <span id="k5-eg-1">overall responsiveness</span> of the desktop version. In the issue I described the problem, how to reproduce it and then show the expected behavior vs current behavior. I then solved the issue at hand and created a pull request with the solutions that I used to solve the problem. Followed by merging the branch with the main branch once the pull request had been approved. For document purposes the issue I linked to the pull request.  </p>

          Collaborate effectively as employees and leaders in the management and
          implementation of projects.
        </h3>
        <p>
          During this internship I was fortunate to be assigned a fellow
          internship buddy who I collaborated with on the project. We worked
          together from design to deployment (CI), which meant that we had to
          communicate a lot. Both regarding the work itself but also how we
          wanted to work together in able to end the internship feeling
          satisfied with our efforts. For both of us this meant delivering a
          final product that our stakeholders would be happy with but also leave
          feeling like we learned something.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the internship was fully remote and as we had to divide some of the
          tasks in able to work more effectively, I felt that it was important
          for us to maintain a good culture and practice the "trust and openness
          spiral". Due to freedom, but also responsibility that came with having
          such a flexible workspace, I made sure to communicate whenever I had
          hindrances (those related to work but also personal ones) that would
          affect my work. This was we were able to adjust our weekly sprint
          accordingly. A tool that really helped us with this was having daily
          stand-ups, during which we could adjust the plans for the day
          accordingly if needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the purpose of collaborating a number of tools were used. Kindly
          see below:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Figma</b> for the design phase, which was great at it offers the
          ability for multiple users to work in the same document. This was in
          particularly helpful as we were able to get and received feedback
          visually was well, rather than only explaining our feedback with
          words.

          and communication, both tools great because they are free to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>VSC live-share</b> We used to for pair-programming. In the
          beginning of the implementation phase, it was very important for us to
          work closely together as to ensure that we both were on board
          regarding the tasks at hand. We started off with header and
          implemented it together before dividing and individually working the
          remaining sections of the page. I think that this helped us
          synchronize more as progressed with the project, as we have agreed on
          the structure together in the beginning.

          completion of project.
        </h3>

        <p>
          In the beginning of the project this was particularly important as our
          stakeholders did not have any concrete ideas for how they wanted the
          landing page to look like. They wanted to appeal to a broad audience,
          however they had no ideas regarding the design itself. This meant that
          I and my internship buddy had to design in iterations and ask for
          feedback after each step (wire-framing, loFi & hiFi ). This also meant
          that we had to communicate in ways that were empathetic, and remind
          the stakeholder that our job was to support their vision and not the
          other way around. As the stakeholders also had access to our Figma
          files, they were able to follow the work that we were doing in
          real-time and come with relevant feedback as we were working (did not
          have to wait until our next meeting). I believed that practicing
          having transparency in this fashion helped strengthen the trust
          between us and the stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>An important part of the internship for me was learning how to work and communicate effectively. As our mentor had other obligations, I felt that it was important to be mindful of our exchanges and how often they happened. This gave me the opportunity to work more independently. As demonstrated in on how I worked with "overall responsiveness" issue in <span><a href="#k5-eg-1">K5</a></span>, where I created the issue and implemented a solution before asking what solution they preferred in the pull request and its review. As they were happy with and approved the solution presented, I only needed to have that one exchange regarding this bug.  </p>

        <p>
          During the implementation phase I made sure to openly communicate with
          our mentor whenever I ran into issues that I felt like were taking too
          long to solve or required their decisions-making for the progression
          of the project. At times I would inform our stakeholders that the task
          at hand required me to acquire some more knowledge either through
          their help directly or by taking an online course. Other times I would
          schedule a meeting with them for more in depth meeting regarding the
          issue at hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below are some snippets of the communication between me and our
          stakeholders for the purpose of this course goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Code review:</b> I specifically asked my mentor to share his
          feedback openly and without holding back as I wanted to. This was
          really helpful as I was able to received feedback on my coding style
          and advice on how to write cleaner code.
