          <p>During this internship I was fortunate to be assigned a fellow internship buddy who I collaborated with on the project. We worked together from design to deployment (CI), which meant that we had to communicate a lot. Both regarding the work itself but also how we wanted to work together in able to end the internship feeling satisfied with our efforts. For both of us this meant delivering a final product that our stakeholders would be happy with but also leave feeling like we learned something.</p>

          <p>As the internship was remote and as we had to devide some of the tasks in able to work more effectively, I felt that it was also important for us to maintain a good culture and practice the "trust and openness spiral". </p>

          Independently treat relationships with and expectations of customers and stakeholders in such a way that it leads to further learning and completion of project.
          </h3>
         
          <p>In the beginning of the project this was particularly important as our stakeholders did not have any concrete ideas for how they wanted the landing page to look like. They wanted to appeal to a broad audience, however they had no ideas regarding the design itself. This meant that I and my internship buddy had to design in iterations and ask for feedback after each step (wire-framing, loFi & hiFi ). This also meant that we had to communicate in ways that were empathetic, and remind the stakeholder that our job was to support their vision and not the other way around. As the stakeholders also had access to our Figma files, they were able to follow the work that we were doing in real-time and come with relevant feedback as we were working (did not have to wait until our next meeting).  I believed  that practicing having transparency in this fashion helped strengthen the trust between us and the stakeholders.</p>

          <p>During the implementation phase I made sure to openly communicate with our mentor whenever I ran into issues that I felt like were taking too long to solve or required their decisions-making for the progression of the project. At times I would inform our stakeholders that the task at hand required me to acquire some more knowledge either through their help directly or by taking an online course. Other times I would schedule a meeting with them for more in depth meeting regarding the issue at hand.</p>

          <p>Below are some snippets of the communication between me and our stakeholders for the purpose of this course goal. </p>
