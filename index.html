        During the fourth course period I had an internship at Judilica, a
        start-up that develops digital tools for legal work (mainly). The
        internship was fully remote and lasted for six months, during which I
        and a fellow intern had the task of creating the company's landing
        page from design to deployment (CI/CD). The frontend technologies (stack) that
        I worked with with during the internship were
        Next.js, React, TypeScript and Sass.

          Judilica as a company is one that aim to work in an agile fashion.
          I noticed this from the very start at our introduction meeting with
          the team. The meeting started off with a small team development
          session and even though it was held online, I felt as though I was able to get to know and connect with the
          entire team. In regards to

          (posited by Bruce Tuckman), this session took the new team
          constellation from forming to norming. This was really good because
          even though I was mainly in contact with our mentor, I still felt
          comfortable reaching out the other members of the team when it was
          necessary throughout the internship.
        </p>

        <p>
          The entire team collaborated in Notion (in regards to planning) and we were assigned our
          own workspace for the landing page, which we were responsible of
          populating and maintaining. Below is a picture from the kanban board
          that I and the fellow intern created and maintained throughout the
          internship. The purpose of the kanban board was to help visualize work
          and maximize efficiency (flow). During the design phase we created the
          different tasks for the board directly in Notion, during the implementation phase
          the tasks were generated from our Github issues.

        <p>
          I also worked with Scrum throughout the project, working in
          iterations (1 - 4 weeks sprints). We started of each sprint by reviewing our
          backlog as well as discussing and deciding on the features that we were to 
          implement for the sprint (sprint planning and creating a sprint backlog).
          Everyday we would have a daily stand-up where I shared briefly about my progress or struggles and what my aim was for the day. At the end of each sprint we would have an increment, during
          which we presented the work we had carried out to our mentor
          and receive feedback, which we would review at the start of the
          following sprint (sprint review and retrospective). 
        </p>

        <p>
          I also had the opportunity to learn more and work
          with test-driven development (TDD) during my internship. Throughout the project I continuously deployed (CI/CD) new branches using Github and Vercel to ensure that they worked properly before merging them with the main branch. Below is an image from our
          slack channel of automated messages from Vercel with two deployments
          that I made.

        <h3>Methods of quality assurance.</h3>
        <h4>
          Below is the process of quality assurance that I applied
          during my internship:
        </h4>

        <p>
          I began each new feature/fix by creating a new branch for the feature/fix that I was going to develop. This enabled for a more manage way to
          conduct unit testing during the implementation, before the
          integration (TDD). Once I was done developing the
          first iteration of the feature/fix, I would push it to our remote
          repository and create a pull request in Github. My mentor would then review the
          code (static testing) and then share feedback on what could be
          improved. The process would then repeat until the pull request was
          approved. Before merging the pull
          request with main, I had to make sure that it  passed a few Github Pull Request
          Checks that had been configured by our mentor, the most important being a successful deployment of the
          branch via Vercel. Once all the Checks were passed and conflicts
          resolved between the branch and the main branch, the branch
          was ready to me merged with main.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also learned that whilst working with CI/CD, it was wise to run a
          build test locally to amend any build issues and errors before pushing
          the code. As well as configure auto formatting to avoid running into
          unnecessary conflicts, in particularly when working a project with
          multiple developer.

        <h4>
          Other methods of quality assurance that I worked with during CP4 were
          :
        </h4>
        <p>
          &#x2747; Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), in particularly when
          designing the landing page. Things such as checking the color contrast
          of the buttons with a color checking tool and increasing the font
          weight on smaller text to increase the accessibility visually. When
          working with the different animations on the page, I also took in
          consideration not to go overboard with the different effects for the
          same purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          &#x2747; TypeScript (instead of JavaScript) which I consider to be a
          method of quality assurance when developing as it helps catch mistakes
          early through a type system and makes debugging easier.

        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the things that I found rewarding when it came to my internship
          was the opportunity to create the landing page from scratch and have
          responsibility for the entire development. This meant that I got the
          chance to choose work and project methodology, as well as make
          independent decisions about planning and work according to requirement
          specifications set by our mentor (our stakeholder). Below are a few
          occasions in regards this course goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting off I collaborated with my fellow intern to create backlog
          activities for the design process. The main activities that we planned
          and carried out were wire-framing, loFi and hiFi prototyping. The
          wire-framing we collaborated on and created together as we need to be
          on the same page when it came to which features were to be included on
          the landing page. The features that we decided on were based on the
          requirements in the project specification for the landing page, which
          we had received at the beginning of the project.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          After receiving approval from our stakeholder that the wire-frame met
          requirement (mainly that the required features and elements were
          included in the design), we decided to work individually on the loFi
          prototypes. This in order to provide our stakeholders with different
          design options and for us to gain a sense of what appealed to them
          visually. This helped us when it came to hiFi prototyping as the loFi
          design that they had settled for gave a good idea of what design style
          appealed to the stakeholders.

        <p>
          Aside from the required features and elements in the project
          specification, the process requirements of the project was also
          specified in the project specification. Mainly deciding and diving
          everyday operations/work methods with an agile approach, as well as
          using a kanban board (in notion). When developing I utilized Github
          issues to create requirement specifications for both new features that
          I implemented as well as bug fixes. The issues were connected to our
          kanban board in notion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a screenshot of an issue that I created for correcting the
          <span id="k5-eg-1">overall responsiveness</span> of the desktop
          version. In the issue I described the problem, how to reproduce it and
          then show the expected behavior vs current behavior. I then solved the
          issue at hand and created a pull request with the solutions that I
          used to solve the problem. Followed by merging the branch with the
          main branch once the pull request had been approved. For document
          purposes the issue I linked to the pull request.

        <p>
          I was fortunate to be assigned the internship with a fellow intern,
          who I had collaborated with before on a different project. We had
          worked really well together in the past so the team was already at
          <span><a href="#c2-eg-1">norming</a></span> when we kicked off the
          project. Working together from design to deployment (CI/CD) meant that
          we had to communicate a lot. We started off by exchanging our
          expectations for the internship which were aligned. Both of us wanted
          to learn as much as possible from the experience and utilize our
          mentorship to learn industry standards in regards to the different
          activities that we engaged with/in throughout the internship. Our
          mutual goal was to deliver a final product that our stakeholders could
          utilize or further develop. Aligning in this fashion early enabled for
          us to encourage each other throughout the internship and in moments
          where the motivation was low.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the internship was fully remote and as we had to divide some of the
          tasks in able to work more effectively. I felt that it was important
          for us to maintain a good culture and did so by practicing

            open and honest communication </span
          >. Due to the freedom, but also responsibility that came with having
          such a flexible workspace, I made sure to communicate whenever I had
          hindrances (those related to work but also personal ones) that would
          affect my work. eg. sharing when I wasn't feeling well and needed some
          to take the day off. By having daily we could adjust our sprints
          accordingly and set more realistic time management plans. Sharing in
          this fashion also enabled the team to provide with some encouragement
          when I felt low (and vice versa), which improved the overall
          efficiency of our team.

        <p>
          As we had to work together, we opted for tools that allows for
          multiple users to work in the same document/program, Figma (for the
          design) and VSCode (for coding).In the beginning of the implementation
          phase, it was very important for us to work closely together as to
          ensure that we both were on board regarding the tasks at hand. We
          started off with header and implemented it together before dividing
          and individually working the remaining sections of the page. I think
          that this helped us synchronize more the project progressed, as we
          have agreed on the implementation structure together in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, I was a bit reluctant to pair-programming as I thought the
          practice to be time consuming and inefficient (two people working on
          one task). However I soon came to discover that there are a lot of
          benefits to having two people work on the same problem as I was able
          to learn a lot from my fellow intern. During these sessions I
          discovered that I was able to learn and share knowledge in a cohesive
          way (working with both verbal and visual feedback). This was
          particularly important during the initial design phase and when trying
          to align on the design language to use for the landing page.

          An important aspect of the internship for me personally was learning
          how to work and communicate efficiently in relation to our mentor (and
          stakeholders). When we initialized the project I specifically asked
          our mentor to openly and honestly share his feedback. This was due to
          the fact that I wanted to both improve my coding (write cleaner code)
          as well meet the requirements in a way that was satisfying to the
          stakeholders.

          Starting off the project, the stakeholders did not have any concrete
          ideas for how they wanted the landing page to look like. All they knew
          was that they wanted to appeal to a broad audience. This meant that I
          and my fellow intern had to work in iterations and ask for feedback
          after each step (wire-framing, loFi & hiFi ). The feedback that was
          received we then continued to build upon. This also meant that I had
          to communicate an empathetic manner and remind the stakeholder that
          our job was to support their vision (and that I would not take offense
          if they wanted to go in a different direction). As the stakeholders
          also had access to our Figma files, they were able to follow the work
          that we were doing in real-time and come with relevant feedback as we
          were working (did not have to wait until our next meeting). I believed
          that practicing having transparency in this fashion helped the project
          move along more smoothly.

          As our mentor had other obligations, I felt that it was important to
          be mindful of our exchanges and how often they happened. I saw this as
          an opportunity for me to work more independently, as demonstrated in
          on how I worked with "overall responsiveness" issue in
          <span><a href="#k5-eg-1">K5</a></span
          >, where I created the issue and implemented a solution before asking
          what solution our mentor preferred in the pull request review. Him
          approving the of solution presented meant that we only needed to have
          one exchange regarding this bug fix.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the implementation phase I made sure to openly communicate with
          our mentor whenever I ran into issues that I felt like were taking too
          long to solve or required their decisions-making for the progression
          of the project. At times I would inform our stakeholders that the task
          at hand required me to acquire some more knowledge either through
          their help directly or by taking an online course. Other times I would
          schedule a meeting with them for more in depth meeting regarding the
          issue at hand. Below is an exchange between me and my mentor during which I received some advice on how to solve an task.
