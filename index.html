        During the fourth course period I had an internship at Judilica, a
        start-up that develops digital tools for legal work (mainly). The
        internship was fully remote and lasted for six months, during which I
        and a fellow intern had the task of creating the company's landing page
        from design to deployment (CI/CD). The frontend technologies (stack)
        that I worked with with during the internship were Next.js, React,
        TypeScript and Sass.

        <p>
          Judilica as a company is one that aim to work in an agile fashion. I
          noticed this from the very start at our introduction meeting with the
          team. The meeting started off with a small team development session
          and even though it was held online, I felt as though I was able to get
          to know and connect with the entire team. In regards to
          <a

          >

          (posited by Bruce Tuckman), this session took the new team
          constellation from forming to

          This was really good because even though I was mainly in contact with
          our mentor, I still felt comfortable reaching out the other members of
          the team when it was necessary throughout the internship.
        </p>

        <p>
          The entire team collaborated in Notion (in regards to planning) and we
          were assigned our own workspace for the landing page, which we were
          responsible of populating and maintaining. Below is a picture from the
          kanban board that I and the fellow intern created and maintained
          throughout the internship. The purpose of the kanban board was to help
          visualize work and maximize efficiency (flow). During the design phase
          we created the different tasks for the board directly in Notion,
          during the implementation phase the tasks were generated from our
          Github Issues.

        </div>

        <p>
          I also worked with Scrum throughout the project, working in iterations
          (1 - 4 weeks sprints). We started of each sprint by reviewing our
          backlog as well as discussing and deciding on the features that we
          were to implement for the sprint (sprint planning and creating a
          sprint backlog). Everyday we would have a daily stand-up where I
          shared briefly about my progress or struggles and what my aim was for
          the day. At the end of each sprint we would have an increment, during
          which we presented the work we had carried out to our mentor and
          receive feedback, which we would review at the start of the following
          sprint (sprint review and retrospective).
        </p>

        <p>
          I also had the opportunity to learn more and work with test-driven
          development (TDD) during my internship. Throughout the project I
          continuously deployed (CI/CD) new branches using Github and Vercel to
          ensure that they worked properly before merging them with the main
          branch. Below is an image from our slack channel of automated messages
          from Vercel with two deployments that I made.

        <h3>Methods of quality assurance.</h3>
        <h4>
          Below is the process of quality assurance that I applied during my
          internship:
        </h4>

        <p>
          I began each new feature/fix by creating a new branch for the
          feature/fix that I was going to develop. This enabled for a more
          manage way to conduct unit testing during the implementation, before
          the integration (TDD). Once I was done developing the first iteration
          of the feature/fix, I would push it to our remote repository and
          create a pull request in Github. My mentor would then review the code
          (static testing) and then share feedback on what could be improved.
          The process would then repeat until the pull request was approved.
          Before merging the pull request with main, I had to make sure that it
          passed a few Github Pull Request Checks that had been configured by
          our mentor, the most important being a successful deployment of the
          branch via Vercel. Once all the Checks were passed and conflicts
          resolved with the main branch, I merged the branch with main.

          I also learned, whilst working with CI/CD, that it is wise to run a
          build test locally to amend any build issues and errors before pushing
          the code. As well as configure automatic formatting to avoid running
          into unnecessary conflicts, in particularly when working a project
          with multiple developer.

          buttons with a color checking tool and increasing the font weight on
          smaller text to increase the accessibility visually. When working with
          the different animations on the page, I also took in consideration not
          to go overboard with the different effects for the same purpose.

        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the things that I found rewarding when it came to my internship
          was the opportunity to create the landing page from scratch and have
          responsibility for the entire development process. We were both
          assigned Co-Project Lead for the project. This meant that I had the
          chance to choose work and project methodology, as well as make
          independent decisions about planning and work according to requirement
          specifications set by our mentor (part of the stakeholders). Below are
          a few occasions reflecting my engagement with this course goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting off I collaborated with a fellow intern to create backlog
          activities for the design process. The main activities that we planned
          and carried out were wire-framing, loFi and hiFi prototyping. We
          collaborated on and created the wire-framing together as we needed to
          be on the same page when it came to which features were to be included
          on the landing page. The features that we decided on were based on the
          requirements in the project specification for the landing page, which
          we had received at the beginning of the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          After receiving approval from our stakeholders that the wire-frame met
          set requirements (mainly that the required features and elements were
          included in the design), we decided to work individually on the loFi &
          hiFi prototypes. This in order to provide our stakeholders with
          different design options and for us to gain a better sense of what
          appealed to them visually. This approach helped me when it came to
          hiFi prototyping, as the loFi design that they had settled for gave me
          an idea of what design style appealed to the stakeholders. Below are
          two different iterations of the loFi designs.

          Aside from the required features and elements in the project
          specification, the process requirements of the project was also
          specified in the project specification. Mainly "deciding and diving
          everyday operations/work methods with an agile approach", as well as
          utilize a kanban board (in Notion). When developing I utilized Github
          Issues to create requirement specifications for both new features that
          I implemented as well as bug fixes. The Issues were connected to our
          kanban board in Notion.

        <p>
          Below is a screenshot of an issue that I created for correcting the

            >overall responsiveness</span
          >
          on the desktop version. In the Issue I described the bug, how to
          reproduce it and then shared a photo of the expected behavior vs
          current behavior. I then solved the bug and created a pull request
          with the solutions that I used to solve it. Followed by merging the
          branch with the main branch, once the pull request had been approved
          by my mentor. For document purposes I linked the Issue to the pull
          request.

          I was really fortunate to be assigned the internship with a fellow

          already at
          <span><a href="#c2-eg-1">norming</a></span> when we kicked off the
          project as we had worked really well together prior to this
          experience. Working together from design to deployment (CI/CD) meant
          that we had to communicate a lot. This required me to really practice
          being both patient (whilst explaining and sharing knowledge) and
          humble (in order to learn new things).
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting off we exchanged our expectations for the internship, which
          were aligned. Both of us wanted to learn as much as possible from the
          experience and utilize the mentorship to learn industry standards in
          regards to the different activities that we engaged with/in throughout
          the internship. Our mutual goal was to deliver a final product that
          our stakeholders could utilize or further develop for their needs.
          Aligning in this fashion early on enabled for us to encourage each
          other throughout the internship, and in moments where the motivation
          was low.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internship was fully remote and we had to divide some of the tasks
          in able to work more effectively. We went with the agile approach of
          working on one task on the kanban board at a time. In able to maintain

          having such a flexible workspace, I made sure to communicate whenever
          I had hindrances (related to work as well as personal) that would
          affect my work. eg. sharing when I wasn't feeling well and needed to
          take the day off. By sharing during our daily stand-ups, we were able
          adjust our sprints accordingly and set more realistic time management
          plans. Sharing in this fashion also enabled the team to provide with
          some encouragement when I felt low (and vice versa), which improved
          the overall efficiency of our team.

          As we needed to work together throughout the project, we opted for
          tools that allow for multiple users to work in the same
          document/program. We mainly used Notion (planning), Figma (design),
          VSCode (implementation) and Github (version control). In the beginning
          of the implementation phase, I felt that it was important for us to
          work closely together to ensure that we both on the same page. We
          started off with header component and implemented it together before
          dividing and individually working the remaining features (components)
          of the page. It took us longer to get started however, I felt that we
          were synchronized from the start and could easily jump in and review
          each other's code, as a result of agreeing on the implementation
          structure together in the beginning.

          Initially, I was a bit reluctant to pair-programming as I thought the
          practice to be time consuming and inefficient (two people working on
          one task). However I have come to learn that there are a lot of
          benefits to having two people working on the same problem. I was able
          to learn a lot from my fellow intern through our pair-programming
          sessions (and vice versa). One of the major benefits that I discovered
          was the opportunity to share knowledge in a more cohesive way (working
          with both verbal and visual feedback). This was particularly helpful
          when creating the wire-frame and when trying to align on the design
          language to for the landing page.

        <p>
          Starting off the project, the stakeholders did not have any concrete
          ideas for how they wanted the landing page to appear. During the
          design phase, I and my the intern had to work in iterations and ask
          for feedback after each step (wire-framing, loFi & hiFi ). The
          feedback we received we then continued to build upon. This also meant
          that I had to communicate an empathetic manner and remind the
          stakeholder that our job was to support their vision (and that I would
          not take offense if they wanted to go in a different direction). As
          the stakeholders also had access to our Figma files, they were able to
          follow the work that we were doing in real-time and come with relevant
          feedback as we were working (did not have to wait until the next
          increment). I believed that practicing having transparency in this
          fashion helped the project move along more smoothly.

          As our mentor had other obligations, I felt that it was important to
          be mindful of our exchanges and how often they took place. I also saw
          this as an opportunity for me to work more independently. As
          demonstrated in how I worked with the "overall responsiveness" bug in
          <span><a href="#k5-eg-1">K5</a></span
          >, where I created an Issue (task) and implemented a solution
          <i><b>before</b></i> asking what solution our mentor preferred in, and
          when the pull request was ready for review. Him approving the of
          solution presented meant that I only needed to have one exchange with
          regarding this bug fix.

          During the implementation phase I made sure to openly communicate with
          my mentor whenever I ran into issues that I felt like were taking too
          long to solve. I would first access and see if I needed to acquire
          some more knowledge on the topic (eg. taking an online course) or if
          it was an issue he could help solve directly. On a few occasions (and
          when he had the time to spare) I would him schedule a meeting with my
          for more in depth explanations. Below is an exchange between me and my
          mentor during which I received some advice on how to solve an task via
          messaging in Slack.

          An important aspect of the internship for me personally was learning
          how to work and communicate efficiently with my mentor. When we
          initialized the project I specifically asked him to openly and
          honestly share his feedback. This due to the fact that I genuinely
          wanted to both improve my coding (write cleaner code) as well meet the
          project specification requirements and complete the project in a way
          that was satisfying to the stakeholders. I felt like I was able to achieve both things by the end of the internship.
